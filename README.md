# reactjs-orange-county

This repo is for members of [ReactJS-OC](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-OC/). As the meetup organizer I am experimenting with different ways to encourage participation in the spirit of open source.

## Goals

* Members have topics they're interested in and I want them to voice their wishes
* Members are interested in presenting and I want to give them an outline
